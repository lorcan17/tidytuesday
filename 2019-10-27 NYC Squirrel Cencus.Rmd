# 2019-10-27 NYC Squirrel Census

This is a great dataset with lots of variables. I'm going to use this dataset to practise my machine learning techniques.

I'm going to create a model that can accuractely predict if a squirrel is on the ground or above the ground.

I'm going to be using the tidymodels workflow, and following this helpful guide:
https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-with-tidymodels-and-parsnip-bae2c01c131c
https://www.benjaminsorensen.me/post/modeling-with-parsnip-and-tidymodels/
https://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/implementing-the-super-learner-with-tidymodels/

Read in the data
```{r Set Up, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "README_figs/README-"
)
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(knitr)
library(janitor)
library(xgboost)
```

Now clean
```{r Clean Data, warning=FALSE}
nyc_squirrels_raw <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-29/nyc_squirrels.csv")
nyc_squirrels <- nyc_squirrels_raw %>% mutate(shift = as_factor(shift),
                                              date = mdy(date),
                                              age = fct_explicit_na(fct_relevel(age,"Juvenile")),
                                              primary_fur_color = fct_explicit_na(primary_fur_color),
                                              #highlight_fur_color = fct_explicit_na(highlight_fur_color))
                                              location = fct_explicit_na(fct_relevel(location,"Ground Plane")))
# Only interested in the below variables
nyc_squirrels <- nyc_squirrels %>%  select(date,age,primary_fur_color,location,running,chasing,climbing,eating,foraging, kuks,tail_flags,approaches,indifferent,runs_from)

```

Given that there are only 64 missing data points for location, I will remove these.

```{r warning=FALSE}
nyc_squirrels %>% count(location)
nyc_squirrels <- nyc_squirrels %>% filter(location != "(Missing)") %>% droplevels()

```

### Train and Test Split
Firstly, create a randomised training and test plit of the original data.

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
train_test_split <- initial_split(data = nyc_squirrels,prop = 0.8)

train_set <- training(train_test_split)
test_set <- testing(train_test_split)

```

### Create recipe
Here we prep a recipe for how we want to transform our data and then apply these steps to the train and test set.

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
recipe <- recipe(location ~ ., data = train_set) %>% 
  step_dummy(primary_fur_color,age,one_hot = T) %>% 
  prep(train_set)

train_baked <- bake(recipe,new_data = train_set)
test_baked <- bake(recipe,new_data = test_set)
```

### Fit the model

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
boost_tree <- boost_tree(mode = "classification") %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  fit(location ~ ., data = train_baked)

importance <- xgb.importance(feature_names = colnames(train_baked %>% select(-location)),model = boost_tree$fit)

xgb.plot.importance(importance)
```

### Performance Assesment

```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb <- boost_tree %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_baked) %>% 
  bind_cols(test_baked %>% select(location))
```

There are several metrics that can be used to investigate the performance of a classification model but for simplicity Iâ€™m only focusing on a selection of them: accuracy, precision, recall and F1_Score.

```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb %>%
  conf_mat(location, .pred_class) %>%
  pluck(1) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot(aes(Prediction, Truth, alpha = n)) +
  geom_tile(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), colour = "white", alpha = 1, size = 8)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb %>%
  conf_mat(location, .pred_class) %>% summary() %>% 
  select(-.estimator) %>%
  filter(.metric %in%
    c("accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f_meas")) %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Wow, so on first go it seems we have built a model which can fairly accuractely predict if a squirrel is above ground or not.

```{r warning=FALSE}
boost_tree %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_baked,type = "prob") %>% clean_names %>% select(pred_ground_plane) %>% 
  bind_cols(test_baked %>% select(location)) %>% 
  gain_curve(truth = location,pred_ground_plane) %>% autoplot()
  
```

### Hyper Parameter Tuning
Create a random grid of parameters object values. Parameters we can tune can be found here: 
https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/reference/boost_tree.html

I have chosen to tune mtry, learn rate, and tree depth only but could have tuned all found in the above link.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(dials)
set.seed(seed = 1) 

xgb_grid <- grid_random(
mtry(c(1,10)),
learn_rate(c(0,1),trans = NULL),
tree_depth(c(1,20)),
size = 10) %>% mutate(model_id = row_number()) 

xgb_grid
```

Now use K-Fold Cross-Validation to determine which set of parameters is the most accurate. 

Reminder:
3-Fold CV is split into 3 equal sized groups and is tested like below:
*Model1: Trained on Fold1 + Fold2, Tested on Fold3
*Model2: Trained on Fold2 + Fold3, Tested on Fold1
*Model3: Trained on Fold1 + Fold3, Tested on Fold2

https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/

### Tune 1

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
folds <- vfold_cv(train_set,6,2)

set.seed(seed = 1) 
folded <-  folds %>% 
  # Cross join the xvg grid create above
  expand_grid(xgb_grid) %>% 
  # Then create analysis and assesment sets
  mutate(analysis = map(splits, analysis),
  assesment = map(splits, assessment),
  # Create a Recipe. Prepper is a wrapper for `prep()` which handles `split` objects
  recipe = map(splits,~prepper(.x,recipe(location ~ ., data = train_set) %>% 
  step_dummy(primary_fur_color,age,one_hot = T))),
  # Now bake analysis and assesment sets
  analysis = map2(recipe,analysis,bake),
  assesment = map2(recipe,assesment,bake),
  # Run model against analysis set with values for parameter objects defined
  boost_tree = pmap(list(mtry,learn_rate,tree_depth,analysis),
  ~ boost_tree(mode = "classification",mtry= ..1,learn_rate = ..2,tree_depth= ..3) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  fit(location ~ ., data = ..4)
  ),
  # Create predictions for each model on the assesment set
  predictions_xgb = map2(
  assesment,
  boost_tree,
  ~
  predict(.y, new_data = .x) %>%
  bind_cols(.x %>% select(location))
  ),
  # Compute accuracy metric
  accuracy = map(predictions_xgb,~ accuracy(., truth = location, estimate = .pred_class))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(accuracy)



# Visualise model performance by model id
folded %>% ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(model_id), y = .estimate)) + geom_boxplot()

# Table of top model combinations
hi <- folded %>% group_by(model_id) %>% summarise(.estimate = median(.estimate)) %>% ungroup( )%>% filter(.estimate >0.85) %>% 
  inner_join(xgb_grid) %>% arrange(desc(.estimate))
hi
#  Variance of model accuracy by paramter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate,colour = as_factor(model_id))) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 

# Mean accuracy for each parameter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% group_by(name,value) %>% summarise(.estimate = mean(.estimate)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 
             
```

Looking at the learn_rate graph we see that learn rates < 0.5 perform worse. Let's edit this parameter to only include 0.5 to 1 and rerun. Tree depth also looks like it can be reduced to between 1 and 10 but I will only make one change at a time.

# Tune 2
```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 2) 
xgb_grid <- grid_random(
mtry(c(1,10)),
learn_rate(c(0.5,1),trans = NULL),
tree_depth(c(1,20)),
size = 10) %>% mutate(model_id = row_number()) 

xgb_grid
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
folds <- vfold_cv(train_set,6,2)

set.seed(seed = 1) 
folded <-  folds %>% 
  # Cross join the xvg grid create above
  expand_grid(xgb_grid) %>% 
  # Then create analysis and assesment sets
  mutate(analysis = map(splits, analysis),
  assesment = map(splits, assessment),
  # Create a Recipe. Prepper is a wrapper for `prep()` which handles `split` objects
  recipe = map(splits,~prepper(.x,recipe(location ~ ., data = train_set) %>% 
  step_dummy(primary_fur_color,age,one_hot = T))),
  # Now bake analysis and assesment sets
  analysis = map2(recipe,analysis,bake),
  assesment = map2(recipe,assesment,bake),
  # Run model against analysis set with values for parameter objects defined
  boost_tree = pmap(list(mtry,learn_rate,tree_depth,analysis),
  ~ boost_tree(mode = "classification",mtry= ..1,learn_rate = ..2,tree_depth= ..3) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  fit(location ~ ., data = ..4)
  ),
  # Create predictions for each model on the assesment set
  predictions_xgb = map2(
  assesment,
  boost_tree,
  ~
  predict(.y, new_data = .x) %>%
  bind_cols(.x %>% select(location))
  ),
  # Compute accuracy metric
  accuracy = map(predictions_xgb,~ accuracy(., truth = location, estimate = .pred_class))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(accuracy)



# Visualise model performance by model id
folded %>% ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(model_id), y = .estimate)) + geom_boxplot()

# Table of top model combinations
hi <- folded %>% group_by(model_id) %>% summarise(.estimate = median(.estimate)) %>% ungroup( )%>% filter(.estimate >0.85) %>% 
  inner_join(xgb_grid) %>% arrange(desc(.estimate))
hi
#  Variance of model accuracy by paramter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate,colour = as_factor(model_id))) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 

# Mean accuracy for each parameter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% group_by(name,value) %>% summarise(.estimate = mean(.estimate)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 
           
```

From the above it apears an mtry around 5 works best. Let's change that parameter next.

### Tune 3

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 3) 
xgb_grid <- grid_random(
mtry(c(7,7)),
learn_rate(c(0.5,0.8),trans = NULL),
tree_depth(c(1,5)),
size = 10) %>% mutate(model_id = row_number()) 

xgb_grid
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
folds <- vfold_cv(train_set,6,2)

set.seed(seed = 1) 
folded <-  folds %>% 
  # Cross join the xvg grid create above
  expand_grid(xgb_grid) %>% 
  # Then create analysis and assesment sets
  mutate(analysis = map(splits, analysis),
  assesment = map(splits, assessment),
  # Create a Recipe. Prepper is a wrapper for `prep()` which handles `split` objects
  recipe = map(splits,~prepper(.x,recipe(location ~ ., data = train_set) %>% 
  step_dummy(primary_fur_color,age,one_hot = T))),
  # Now bake analysis and assesment sets
  analysis = map2(recipe,analysis,bake),
  assesment = map2(recipe,assesment,bake),
  # Run model against analysis set with values for parameter objects defined
  boost_tree = pmap(list(mtry,learn_rate,tree_depth,analysis),
  ~ boost_tree(mode = "classification",mtry= ..1,learn_rate = ..2,tree_depth= ..3) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  fit(location ~ ., data = ..4)
  ),
  # Create predictions for each model on the assesment set
  predictions_xgb = map2(
  assesment,
  boost_tree,
  ~
  predict(.y, new_data = .x) %>%
  bind_cols(.x %>% select(location))
  ),
  # Compute accuracy metric
  accuracy = map(predictions_xgb,~ accuracy(., truth = location, estimate = .pred_class))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(accuracy)



# Visualise model performance by model id
folded %>% ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(model_id), y = .estimate)) + geom_boxplot()

# Table of top model combinations
hi <- folded %>% group_by(model_id) %>% summarise(.estimate = median(.estimate)) %>% ungroup( )%>% filter(.estimate >0.85) %>% 
  inner_join(xgb_grid) %>% arrange(desc(.estimate))
hi
#  Variance of model accuracy by paramter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate,colour = as_factor(model_id))) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 

# Mean accuracy for each parameter values
folded %>% select(mtry:model_id,.estimate) %>% group_by(model_id)%>% pivot_longer(mtry:tree_depth) %>% group_by(name,value) %>% summarise(.estimate = mean(.estimate)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = value,y = .estimate)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~name,scales ="free_x") 
           
```

## Choose parameters
Our best performing model was using the following parameters:

Now let's use this on the testing set.

### Fit the model
```{r warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed = 1) 
boost_tree <- boost_tree(mode = "classification",mtry= 7,learn_rate = 0.75,tree_depth= 1) %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  fit(location ~ ., data = train_baked)

importance <- xgb.importance(feature_names = colnames(train_baked %>% select(-location)),model = boost_tree$fit)

xgb.plot.importance(importance)
```

### Performance Assesment
```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb <- boost_tree %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_baked) %>% 
  bind_cols(test_baked %>% select(location))
```

There are several metrics that can be used to investigate the performance of a classification model but for simplicity Iâ€™m only focusing on a selection of them: accuracy, precision, recall and F1_Score.

```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb %>%
  conf_mat(location, .pred_class) %>%
  pluck(1) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot(aes(Prediction, Truth, alpha = n)) +
  geom_tile(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), colour = "white", alpha = 1, size = 8)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
predictions_xgb %>%
  conf_mat(location, .pred_class) %>% summary() %>% 
  select(-.estimator) %>%
  filter(.metric %in%
    c("accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f_meas")) %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```

All in all, not a bad score. Although I wonder if we could have gotten similar score by the following logic:
If Swquirrel Climbing then Above Plane

```{r warning=FALSE}

nyc_squirrels %>% 
  mutate(guess = as_factor(if_else(climbing,'Above Ground','Ground Plane'))) %>% 
  accuracy(estimate = guess,truth = location)
```

Well, it turns out guessing it's Above Plane if it's climbing gets you a accuracy of %84.5 which is more than our model!

Back to the drawing board...

### Next Steps: Fit the metalearner
Use a multinomial regression as the metalearner.
